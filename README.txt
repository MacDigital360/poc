POC (Portable Preprocessor Compile-time Configurator) is a collection of C preprocessor symbols to select manually or
detect automatically certain properties of the target platform compiled for, e.g. the compiler used, the target operating
system, or target 64bit data model, etc.

Some target configurations will trigger #error preprocessor symbols - this means that the selected configuration hasn't
been tested yet, so be careful and watch what happens.
